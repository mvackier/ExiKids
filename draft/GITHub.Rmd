Think about the 3 stages !!

Use :
- git add filePattern
		for adding new files or updated files for next commit
	git reset [filePattern]
			if made mistakes
	git add -u 
		so that it will stage the modified and deleted files.
- git commit [-m "Added gitignore for file2"]
	commit those added to ...
	git status
		to see what is staged for commit
- git push
	all commits are local so this pushes it to the hub
- git pull
	update with latests
